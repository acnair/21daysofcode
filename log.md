## Day 0 : 26 March 2020

**It's my birthday today and I thought I would give it a pass as it's Day 0. I know it's procastination but, I really really need this. So will be doing some extra time the next day.**

## Day 1 : 27 March 2020

**Thoughts before starting: It feels like a good day to start learning and doing something productive. I would be making efforts in reitrating the JS basics again.**

**Today's progress: Started using Eloquent JS. It was Day 1 and I am happy, sat for almos 45 mins. Thank God I had made notes and I could easuly go through them. Solved 2 questions and it looks good. Not optimised still.**

[Day 1's work](https://github.com/acnair/learn/tree/master/javaScript/B1-EloquentJS/trial) 

**Next day rough plan: Will be completinng excercise of Chapter 2, and will be moving to Chapter 3**

## Day : 28 March 2020

**Thoughts before starting: Surprising making time for this. Spent my time from morining to noon in BLENDER. I guess qurantine makes you try all the stuff. So looking forward to complete that excersie, optimise it, and move to next chapter.**

**Today's progress:Optimised the first 2 question, it was actually simple, I didn't think in the right direction. Third question was a 'chessboard pattern', code seems right but somehow the ```console.log()``` doesn't print it properly, will be rectifying soon.**

**Thoughts on today's progress:By doing that almost and hour went by. This is getting intresting and it's TIME CONSUMING. Will be focusing on this in the morning and BLENDER after this.**

**Next day rough plan: 3rd Chapter is about Function, will be starting that tommorow.**
