## Day 0 : 26 March 2020

**It's my birthday today and I thought I would give it a pass as it's Day 0. I know it's procastination but, I really really need this. So will be doing some extra time the next day.**

## Day 1 : 27 March 2020

**Thoughts before starting: It feels like a good day to start learning and doing something productive. I would be making efforts in reitrating the JS basics again.**

**Today's progress: Started using Eloquent JS. It was Day 1 and I am happy, sat for almos 45 mins. Thank God I had made notes and I could easuly go through them. Solved 2 questions and it looks good. Not optimised still.**

**Next day rough plan: Will be completinng excercise of Chapter 2, and will be moving to Chapter 3**
