# Rules I will be following.

## Main Commitment

### I will code for at least an 1/2 and hour every day and gradually increase the time from 1/2 an hour to more for the next 21 days.

## Additonal Rules

1. I will update the (Log) [log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

2. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges once I am familar with my stack(the main programming language).

3. If I miss a day that day won't be counted and the next day won't be a new day but the previous day itself.

4. As a compensation to the missed day. The present day's would be increased to half the total time.
i.e. if I missed a day and if I plan to code for 1 hour it would be increased to 1 and 1/2 hour
